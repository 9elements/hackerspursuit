# How to setup hackerpursuit


## Instal iced coffe
  
  For some reason I cannot remember you have to install iced coffee globaly.
  $ npm install iced-coffee-script -g


## Install node packages
  
  cd to the project home dir and do this:
  $ npm install


## Clone repo containing the questions
  
  $ cd ..
  $ git clone git://github.com/9elements/NerdPursuit.git


## Create your own config.coffee for the hackerpursuit project
  
  $ cd ../hackerpursuit
  $ cp config.example.coffee config.coffee

  Mabe you shold ask someone to get a valid config file. Saves you a lot of time ;)
  Be sure that the 'exports.game.questionsPath' is set to the questions directory of the repo that you cloned in the last step.


## Start redis server
  
  Open a new shell and fire up redis:
